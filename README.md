only-connect
============

Love2D Application for running your own Only Connect shows! Because why not.


how to use
====

Look through the example folder to find out how to write your own questions!

How to actually run it:
* Round 1: Tap/Click on a heiroglyph to highlight it, tap again to choose it. Space advances to the next clue. Up agrees with a team's answer, giving them the points, down disagrees, passing it to the other team. Pressing down again when it's been passed over will mean that both teams got it wrong, so the answer is revealed. Continue until all heiroglyphs are answered/panicked about.
* Round 2: See round 1.
* Round 3: Tap for everything. Up agrees to the answer of a group's connection, or down to disagree. The rest is automated!
* Round 4: Similar to round 1, space to advance whatever, up agrees, down disagrees. Plays until time is up.
* Tiebreaker: Simple up/down agree/disagree.

Buzzing in:
* At the start of the game there will be a short "calibration" phase where each team should buzz in once. This will define the keys that buzz in for each team. Please note that UP, DOWN, Q, W, O, P, Esc and SPACE will not be accepted as keys, as they are already reserved by the program.


debug/host console
====

There is a useful debug console that appears only if you are under Windows (I'm a Linux developer so this makes me sad). However, it only outputs useful print() statements so Sublime Text's (or other text editors) debug console, or a Terminal window, will output these too!

Only Connect is the BBC's show. Most of the sound effects (both buzzer sounds and the swoosh sounds) are modified from the audio of the TV show. Please don't sue me.
