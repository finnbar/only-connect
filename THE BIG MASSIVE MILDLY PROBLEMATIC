THE BIG MASSIVE MILDLY PROBLEMATIC
BUG LIST!!!!!!!

> The opponents can buzz in once the question has been answered. Huh. (r4, r1/2/3 same team can buzz in again?!) SOLVED, BUT SHOULD BE CHECKED
> HARDWARE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! IS! PROBLEMATIC!
> Text wrap for very long clues fails -> maybe if clue is too big swap to font or fontt?
> Team names size may miss box...
> SCORING, although that might be hardware. Actually, it probably is. I should run through with keyboard, attempting to mess it up as much as possible. Check the scoring sequence for 1/2/4 - see if the team swap occurs too early. Maybe research love.run() and mess with that to get the desired stuff to happen in the right order?
> Connecting wall will add currently selected ones to the first unsolved group if the team runs out of time. SOLVED
> "Out of time" sound effect SOLVED
> If the buzzer has been pressed, the round 4 timer should pause SOLVED
> Mousearea for rounds 1/2 for top-right heiro are a bit iffy. Are they scaled? SOLVED
> Irritating: debug goes with default team name for the first one. Make it run AFTER importer, please. SOLVED
> Check hardware for double-presses (accidently pressing down twice to reveal clue...)
> CHECK KONAMI CODE PLEASE - SOLVED, because B comes before A (fffffff)
> At the end of the game, force quit as to reset. SOLVED
> THE INFAMOUS APOSTROPHE (and other odd characters) BUG - I've found the source. Windows-encoded files have odd special characters so LOVE2D panics. I will alert Mr Robson and suggest Sublime Text.
> Would be nice: once fourth WRONG clue is pressed in r3, colour it but then quickly fade them all away (perhaps colourTweens = {}?)
> The host needs a way to manually change score in emergencies. IMPLEMENTED - q,w for teama +,- score; o,p for teamb +,- score
> FIND A WAY TO WIN NEXT TIME PERHAPS (WILL PROBABLY NOT BE SOLVED FOR A LONG TIME)
