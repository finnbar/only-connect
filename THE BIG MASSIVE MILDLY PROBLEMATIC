THE BIG MASSIVE MILDLY PROBLEMATIC
BUG LIST!!!!!!!

TODO
> Comment code. Not a bug, but could be really useful to other Lua programmers. All two of them.
> Images in round 1 and 2 should zoom in dramatically then zoom back out.
> Mess with MakeyMakey source to reduce sensitivity significantly
> Check hardware for double-presses (accidently pressing down twice to reveal answer...)
> HARDWARE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! IS! PROBLEMATIC!
> SCORING, although that might be hardware. Actually, it probably is. I should run through with keyboard, attempting to mess it up as much as possible. Check the scoring sequence for 1/2/4 - see if the team swap occurs too early. Maybe research love.run() and mess with that to get the desired stuff to happen in the right order? FURTHER TESTING HAS BASICALLY PROVED THAT IT'S HARDWARE
> FIND A WAY TO WIN NEXT TIME PERHAPS (WILL PROBABLY NOT BE SOLVED FOR A LONG TIME)

So, in summary: HARDWARE and IMAGES

COMPLETE
> The opponents can buzz in once the question has been answered. Huh. (r4, r1/2/3 same team can buzz in again?!) SOLVED, BUT SHOULD BE CHECKED
> Connecting wall will add currently selected ones to the first unsolved group if the team runs out of time. SOLVED
> "Out of time" sound effect SOLVED
> If the buzzer has been pressed, the round 4 timer should pause SOLVED
> Mousearea for rounds 1/2 for top-right heiro are a bit iffy. Are they scaled? SOLVED
> Irritating: debug goes with default team name for the first one. Make it run AFTER importer, please. SOLVED
> CHECK KONAMI CODE PLEASE - SOLVED, because B comes before A (fffffff)
> At the end of the game, force quit as to reset. SOLVED
> THE INFAMOUS APOSTROPHE (and other odd characters) BUG - I've found the source. Windows-encoded files have odd special characters so LOVE2D panics. I will alert Mr Robson and suggest Sublime Text.
> Would be nice: once fourth WRONG clue is pressed in r3, colour it but then quickly fade them all away (perhaps colourTweens = {}?) SOLVED, IMPROVED IN GENERAL! :D
> The host needs a way to manually change score in emergencies. IMPLEMENTED - q,w for teama +,- score; o,p for teamb +,- score
> Text wrap for very long clues fails -> maybe if clue is too big swap to font or fontt? SOLVED, DOES EXACTLY THAT.
> Team names size may miss box... SOLVED THROUGH SAME SOLUTION AS ABOVE
