THE BIG MASSIVE MILDLY PROBLEMATIC
BUG LIST!!!!!!!

> The opponents can buzz in once the question has been answered. Huh.
> HARDWARE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! IS! PROBLEMATIC!
> Text wrap for very long clues fails -> maybe if clue is too big swap to font or fontt?
> SCORING, although that might be hardware. Actually, it probably is. I should run through with keyboard, attempting to mess it up as much as possible. Check the scoring sequence for 1/2/4 - see if the team swap occurs too early. Maybe research love.run() and mess with that to get the desired stuff to happen in the right order?
> Connecting wall will add currently selected ones to the first unsolved group if the team runs out of time.
> "Out of time" sound effect
> If the buzzer has been pressed, the round 4 timer should pause
> Mousearea for rounds 1/2 for top-right heiro are a bit iffy. Are they scaled?
> Irritating: debug goes with default team name for the first one. Make it run AFTER importer, please.
> Check hardware for double-presses (accidently pressing down twice to reveal clue...)
> CHECK KONAMI CODE PLEASE
> At the end of the game, force quit as to reset.
> FIND A WAY TO WIN NEXT TIME PERHAPS
