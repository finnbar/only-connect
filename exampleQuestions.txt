| before you think that the next paragraph must be a joke because it starts with the QUESTIONMASTER and their LAIR, think again please and actually read it. there are some seriously important things to consider in there. thank you.

| WELCOME QUESTIONMASTER
| YOU HAVE FOUND YOURSELF IN THE QUESTIONMASTER'S LAIR, A HOME FOR YOURSELF AND ALL THOSE THAT AIM TO CREATE THE MOST DIFFICULT CONUNDRUMS FOR YOURSELF TO UNLEASH ON THE UNSUSPECTING ONLY CONNECTESTANTS
| BUT YOU WILL HAVE TO PROVE YOUR WORTH
| IN THIS FILE YOU MUST RECORD YOUR RIDDLES - AND ANSWERS - SUCH THAT THIS QUIZ CAN REALLY BEGIN.
| YOU WILL HAVE TO CREATE MANY QUESTIONS, AS YOU USUALLY DO, BUT YOU MUST ADHERE TO A CERTAIN FORM
| QUESTIONS WILL NEED TO BE WRITTEN AS FOLLOWS IN THIS ANCIENT SCRIPTURE:
| FOR THE FIRST AND SECOND ROUNDS, THE ANSWER MUST BE STATED, FOLLOWED BY A TILDA (~) AS TO DECLARE YOUR QUIZZING. EACH ITEM IN THIS QUESTION SHOULD THEN FOLLOW, SEPARATED BY SEMICOLONS (;) BUT BY NO SPACES - ANY SPACES WILL BE TREATED AS PART OF THE ITEM SO WILL LOOK WEIRD.
| A NEWLINE DENOTES A NEW QUESTION.
| FOR ROUND THREE, THE CONNECTION MUST BE STATED, FOLLOWED BY ITS FOUR COMPONENTS, JUST LIKE IN ROUNDS ONE AND TWO. THAT'S IT. THE SOFTWARE WILL MIX UP THE GROUPS FOR YOU, BECAUSE IT'S NICE LIKE THAT. ALSO THAT FINNBAR PERSON THAT WROTE IT SEEMS VERY INTELLIGENT, JUST SAYING, YOU SHOULD THANK HIM OR PLAY NETRUNNER WITH HIM OR SOMETHING I DON'T KNOW. HE SEEMS NICE.
| ROUND FOUR IS EXACTLY LIKE ROUNDS ONE TO THREE, STATE YOUR CONNECTION, TILDA AND LIST WITH SEMICOLONS. NOTE THAT ANYTHING IN BRACKETS WILL BE REMOVED FROM YOUR QUESTION IN THIS ROUND.
| SO, IN SUMMARY, DO THE FOLLOWING

| THINGS YOU SHOULD DO~START WITH AN ANSWER;THEN LIST THE ITEMS;DON'T FORGET SEMICOLONS;HIGHFIVE THAT FINNBAR GUY I GUESS
| ALSO YOU CAN HAVE THE SOFTWARE IGNORE CERTAIN LINES BY PUTTING IT AFTER A PIPE (|)

| THAT'S IT FOR NORMAL QUESTIONS, HOWEVER, THERE ARE THREE BONUS ROUNDS TO BE CONSIDERED, THE PICTURE, MUSIC AND TIEBREAKER QUESTIONS.

| THE PICTURE QUESTIONS SHOULD HAVE AN ASTERISK BEFORE THEM (*)
| THE MUSIC QUESTION SHOULD HAVE A CARET BEFORE IT (^)
| AND THE TIEBREAKER SHOULD BE MARKED WITH A DOLLAR SIGN BEFORE IT ($) (THEREFORE MAKING IT TOTALLY LEGIT)

| ALSO, PLEASE RUN YOUR QUIZ THROUGH ONCE BEFORE THE ACTUAL EVENT - LONG SINGLE WORDS, SUCH AS HUMMINGBIRD, WILL HAVE WEIRD WRAPPING PROBLEMS IN ROUNDS 1-3. REWRITE THEM WITH A SPACE AND DASH TO FIX THIS (E.G HUMMING -BIRD)

| SO NOW WRITE SOME QUESTIONS, HIGHFIVE SOME PROGRAMMERS AND DECIDE WHETHER TO PRONOUNCE HORNED VIPER "HORNED" OR "HORN-ED"

| YOURS,
| SEAMUS DOOMFINDER
